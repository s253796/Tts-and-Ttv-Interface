OOP Concepts in the assignment:

1. Encapsulation:
   - BaseModel hides details like _model_id and _pipeline.
2. Polymorphism:
   - Both TextModel and AudioModel share run(), but work on different inputs.
3. Method Overriding:
   - TextModel overrides run() to add logging.
4. Multiple Inheritance:
   - TextModel inherits from both BaseModel and LoggingMixin.
5. Multiple Decorators:
   - AudioModel.run() is wrapped with @timeit and @memoize together.
